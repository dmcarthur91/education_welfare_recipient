There are 3 code files, which must be run in order.

education_welfare_recipient_1of3_LFS
-> This file uses LFS and QLFS data to create birth cohort-region level estimates of degree level education. File names of raw data reflect those used by UK Data Service at date of download and may have subsequently changed. Code assumes that raw files have been extracted and placed in common 'raw' folder. File paths will need to be updated. 

education_welfare_recipient_2of3_BSAS
-> This file uses BSAS 1987-2018 data to create main outcome and explanatory variables. Includes creation of outcome scales. LFS/QLFS data merged in to create final analysis dataset. File names of raw data reflect those used by UK Data Service at date of download and may have subsequently changed. Code assumes that raw files have been extracted and placed in common 'raw' folder. File paths will need to be updated. 

education_welfare_recipient_3of3_ANALYSIS
-> This file runs all analyses and produces output figures and tables. All figures are exported in publication-ready format as .tif files. Most results tables exported as .rtf files. Tables generally not publication ready, and required some manual formatting in MS Word
